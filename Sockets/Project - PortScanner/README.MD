# 🔍 Python Port Scanner  

A **multi-threaded port scanner** built with Python to quickly scan and identify open ports on a target system.

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Uses Python’s `socket` module for port scanning  
✅ Multi-threaded for faster execution  
✅ Displays open ports in real-time  
✅ Logs scan start and end time  

## 📌 Usage  
```bash
python scanner.py <target_ip>
```

## 📂 Requirements  
- Python 3.x  
- Socket and Threading modules (included in standard library)  

This project was a great way to explore **networking, security, and Python threading**.
