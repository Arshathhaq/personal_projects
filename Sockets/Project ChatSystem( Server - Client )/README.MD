# Client-to-Client Chat System with Sockets  

## Overview  
This project implements a basic client-to-client chat system using Python sockets. It provides a simple yet effective way to establish direct communication between clients through a server, which acts as a message relay.  


## How It Works  
1. The server listens for incoming client connections.  
2. Clients establish a connection and register their names.  
3. Users can send messages to specific recipients by specifying their names.  
4. The server forwards messages to the appropriate recipient.  
5. Clients can continuously exchange messages in real-time.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python** (socket, threading, JSON)  

## Usage  
1. Run the server to start listening for connections.  
2. Launch multiple clients, each with a unique name.  
3. Clients can send and receive messages seamlessly.  

This project is a great starting point for understanding socket programming and real-time communication in Python. ðŸš€
